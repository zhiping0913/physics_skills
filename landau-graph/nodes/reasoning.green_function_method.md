# reasoning.green_function_method — Propagator → Full Quantum Dynamics

## Core Picture

**Why this method?** (§7) Perturbation theory becomes unwieldy at higher orders,
and real physical interactions are STRONG (not weak). Infinite series of
perturbation terms must be summed — requiring QFT-like techniques.
(Systematic construction: Galitsky & Migdal, 1958).

**Key convention (§7): Ĥ' = Ĥ − μN̂.** Heisenberg Ψ-operators use Ĥ', not Ĥ.
At T=0, ground state minimizes ⟨Ĥ'⟩. Green's function depends on μ as a parameter.

The single-particle Green's function G(x,x') = −i⟨T ψ(x)ψ†(x')⟩ encodes
virtually everything about a quantum many-body system:
- Poles in ω → excitation energies (single-particle spectrum)
- Discontinuity at Fermi surface → quasiparticle weight Z
- Imaginary part → lifetime/damping of excitations

**Crucial distinction (§7)**: G(t=−0,r) gives the distribution of TRUE particles
N(p), NOT quasiparticles n(p). These are different quantities. The quasiparticle
concept emerges later from the pole structure of G, not from its equal-time limit.

This is the quantum generalization of the classical propagator
(fundamental solution of equations of motion).

## Algorithm

```
1. Define time-ordered Green's function: G(1,2) = −i⟨T ψ(1)ψ†(2)⟩
   where T is time ordering, averaging is over ground state (T=0)
   or thermal ensemble (T>0).
2. For non-interacting system (G₀): poles at free-particle energies
3. With interactions: Dyson equation G = G₀ + G₀ΣG
   Σ(ω,p) = self-energy (complex: Re→energy shift, Im→lifetime)
4. Spectral function: A(ω,p) = −(1/π) Im G_R(ω,p)
   Peak positions → quasiparticle energies
   Peak widths → inverse lifetimes
5. The t→−0 limit: N/V = −2i G(t=−0, r=0) gives density of TRUE particles.
   The −0 sign is crucial — determines contour closure in upper half-plane.
   At T=0: G₀(t=−0, p) = −iθ(p_F−p) → Fermi step.
```

## Fermi Liquid Example (§1-11)

For normal Fermi liquid: G(ω,p) ≈ Z/(ω − ε(p) + iγ).
Z = quasiparticle residue (0 < Z ≤ 1). ε(p) = v_F(p−p_F).
Residual interactions produce finite lifetime: γ ∝ (ε−ε_F)².

## Why Green's Functions are Universal

- Thermodynamics: N = −i∫ G(ω,p) e^{iω0+} dω d³p/(2π)⁴
- Linear response: χ(q,ω) from two-particle Green's function
- Transport: conductivity from current-current correlation
- The entire diagram technique is built on Green's functions
