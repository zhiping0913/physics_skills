# reasoning.retarded_green_function — Causality → Retarded Solution

## Core Picture

The wave equation □φ = −4πρ has two classes of solutions: retarded
(φ depends on ρ at earlier times) and advanced (depends on later times).
Causality selects retarded: φ(r,t) = ∫ ρ(r', t−R/c)/R dV'.

The reasoning: Lorentz gauge + Maxwell → □A^i = (4π/c)j^i.
Solve with point source δ(R) → φ = χ(t−R/c)/R.
Demand that near origin this reduces to Coulomb law → χ(t) = de(t).
→ φ = de(t−R/c)/R. Superpose: φ = ∫ ρ_{t−R/c}/R dV'.

## Algorithm

```
1. Apply Lorentz gauge ∂_i A^i = 0 to Maxwell equations
2. Obtain decoupled wave equations: □A^i = (4π/c)j^i
3. Seek particular solution for point source: ρ = de(t)δ(R)
4. Spherical symmetry + wave equation → φ = χ(t−R/c)/R
5. Determine χ by requiring Coulomb law at R→0: χ(t) = de(t)
6. General solution by superposition: φ = ∫ ρ(t−R/c)/R dV' + φ₀
7. φ₀, A₀ represent external incoming radiation
```

## Why Retarded, Not Advanced

For radiation FROM a system, the field at large distances must be an
OUTGOING wave ∝ f(t−R/c), not an incoming one ∝ f(t+R/c). The retarded
solution corresponds to the physical boundary condition that radiation
originates from sources and propagates outward.

## Key Insight

The retarded time t' = t − R/c means we "see" the source as it was
when the light was emitted. This is the mathematical expression of the
finite speed of light.

## From LW Potentials to LW Fields

The Liénard-Wiechert potentials for a point charge e moving on trajectory r₀(t):
φ = e/[R − v·R/c]_ret,  A = ev/[c(R − v·R/c)]_ret
where R = r − r₀(t'), t' = t − R/c, and [·]_ret means evaluate at t'.

**Critical algebra step**: E = −∇φ − (1/c)∂A/∂t with RETARDED time t'(r,t).
The chain rule gives ∂/∂r = (∂/∂r)_t' + (∂t'/∂r)∂/∂t'. The denominator
κ = 1 − n·v/c appears from ∂t'/∂r = −n/[c(1 − n·v/c)]. The full fields:
E = e[(n−v/c)(1−v²/c²)/(κ³R²)]_ret + e[n×[(n−v/c)×v̇]/(c²κ³R)]_ret

**Key physical decomposition**:
- First term ∝ 1/R²: velocity field (generalized Coulomb) — no radiation
- Second term ∝ 1/R: acceleration field — RADIATION (energy flux to infinity)
- The κ³ denominator → relativistic beaming: Δθ ~ 1/γ

The reasoning_green_function_method node (Vol.9) extends this concept to
quantum many-body systems. The underlying idea is identical: the propagator
(what happens at (r,t) when a source acts at (r',t')) is the fundamental
building block.
